# Description and Directions for Project Usage
  This project is an easy-to-use program that tracks books. Users may enter a .csv file through the 'import' function and add information about the books individually.
  
  Books can be found, indexed, modified, and more! All changes to the user's books are saved and will reload when re-running the program.


 **To use this project:**
  
  Download the Lua executable. -> Run the code through CTRL + B and follow the prompts in the code. You will need to 'import' the csv file the first time you run the code. 

  The default csv file is saved to Mr. Wilkinson's book collection. 
  
  **Note:** 'Reading the catalog' will not reprint the list of books. Instead, it will show their index number.
